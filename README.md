# Online Sales Portal
This was our Software Engineering Term Project. This system is designed to make an online platform on the web where different persons can buy or sell products to each other.
There is an option for Customer Login where different person can login to buy or sell their product. The customers who are involved in buying and selling, can negotiate the price for an item between
them and buy products. There is also an option for online money transaction if the deal is confirmed. Moreover, there is a scope for manager login which is restricted to specific persons. Manager is responsible for the control of the entire buy sell systems. There are various categories of items that can be bought or sold. Moreover, the manager have the right to add or remove these categories. The manager can also remove the product of poor categories.
